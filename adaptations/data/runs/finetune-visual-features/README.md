# Finetune visual features for multimodal models

Fine-tuning is performed using the run scripts `run.sh` for each model (CLIP-BERT, LXMERT or VisualBERT) and finetuning text data (Wikipedia or LXMERT train data). 

The necessary finetuning data should have been generated as described in [data/README.md](data/README.md) before running the scripts in this folder.

## Use already finetuned visual features

The finetuned visual features should be present in this GitHub repo, since they aren't that large.
